            <h3 class="NameInf">1. Tesla</h3>
            <p>Elon Musk’s Tesla leads the pack in electric vehicle design and innovation. The original Roadster is still in the collection but has since been joined by the Model 3 and S sedans, Model X and Y SUVs, and the space-age-looking Cybertruck. Telsa ranks high in technological innovation and impressive driving distance. The Model 3 was also originally classified as the Best Electic Car in the Consumer Reports top picks. However, this was repealed due to changes in standard feature inclusions, such as dropping radar for camera-based automatic emergency braking.</p>
